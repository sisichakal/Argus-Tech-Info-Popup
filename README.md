ðŸš— Argus Tech Info Popup

Tampermonkey user script that displays a technical summary popup on Argus car spec pages, with color-coded performance data.

This userscript enhances the user experience on largus.fr by automatically extracting key technical specifications from car data sheets and presenting them in a clean, color-coded popup for quick evaluation.
âœ¨ Features

    Automatically displays a popup panel on Argus technical pages with car specs such as:

        Length, weight, trunk capacity

        Real max power, top speed, acceleration

        Urban fuel consumption, wheel size, and architecture

    Color-coded values for quick visual benchmarking (green = strong, red = weak, etc.)

    Highlights architecture (e.g. "quatre cylindres") with a separate styling logic

    Fully non-intrusive and easy to dismiss (click outside or close icon)

    Works automatically on pages under https://www.largus.fr/fiche-technique/*

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Logic

Each spec is evaluated using thresholds defined in the script. For example:

    A top speed above 200 km/h is green, between 190â€“200 is orange, and below is red.

    Reverse scoring is applied to acceleration and fuel consumption (lower is better).

    Architecture is scored by the number of cylinders.

ðŸ”§ Installation

    Install Tampermonkey (browser extension)

    Create a new script and paste the source code

    Visit any Argus fiche technique page and wait 2â€“3 seconds for the popup to appear
